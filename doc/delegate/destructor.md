# _rome::delegate<Ret(Args...), Behavior>::_ **~delegate**

```cpp
~delegate();
```

Destroys the `rome::delegate` instance. If the `rome::delegate` instance took the ownership of a _target_, the _target_ is destroyed too.

## Examples

> TODO: show examples where the target is destroyed and where not!
